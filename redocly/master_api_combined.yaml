      summary: Query a series of detailed snapshots
      description: "To retrieve a collection of `list` query-style snapshots taken\
        \ at the defined intervals, execute a `snapshot` query.\n Each snapshot in\
        \ the result is associated with a timestamp, or the \"effective date\" at\
        \ which date snapshot data was valid.\n This API allows you to request a detailed\
        \ time series from Visier.\n\n Structurally, a `snapshot` query is similar\
        \ to a `list` query, but has the following differences:\n * The `snapshot`\
        \ query may contain a column, `effectiveDateProperty`, that specifies the\
        \ time for each snapshot. To include the `effectiveDateProperty` column, add\
        \ the following object to the columns array:\n    ```json\n    {\n       \
        \ \"columnName\": \"Snapshot_Date\",\n        \"columnDefinition\": {\n  \
        \          \"effectiveDateProperty\": {}\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n * The\
        \ `snapshot` query uses `timeIntervals` (like an `aggregate` query) instead\
        \ of `timeInterval` (like a `list` query) because the `snapshot` query\n \
        \   must specify the number of snapshots to generate. To specify the number\
        \ of snapshots to generate, use the `intervalCount` property in the `timeIntervals`\
        \ object, as shown next.\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"timeIntervals\": {\n\
        \        \"fromDateTime\": \"2022-01-01\",\n        \"intervalPeriodType\"\
        : \"MONTH\",\n        \"intervalPeriodCount\": 6,\n        \"intervalCount\"\

            \n Note: For multi-metric queries, if `direction` is `BACKWARD`, query\

            \ of 2024-01-01'T'00:00:00.000. \n\n Example: If a tenant has Employee\
            \ subject data available from 2023-01-10 to 2023-04-01 (End date exclusive),\
            \ specifying `dynamicDateFrom`: `COMPLETE_PERIOD` with `direction`: `FORWARD`\
